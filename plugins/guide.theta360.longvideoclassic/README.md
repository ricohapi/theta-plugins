## Description

<div id="plugin-description">

Save videos longer than 25 minutes. Uses standard H.264 compression and standard video bitrate. This is an alternative plug-in for people that have problems with the Long Video High Compression Plug-in that uses next-generation compression and non-standard bitrate. For people having problems with Long Video High Compression, this plug-in should work. It is only useful if you need to take a single video that is over 25 minutes and under 45 minutes. The plug-in supports single channel audio. Spatial audio does not work. Metadata is stripped out. You may need to inject metadata using a separate tool. The plug-in does not save camera orientation data to the video. See this document for more information: https://github.com/codetricity/longvideoclassic/blob/master/README.md
