## Description

<div id="plugin-description">

This is the simplest plugin to stream 360 degrees video and audio in real-time. By registering your ID and your THETA devices, you can get the URL for your device. By using the URL, your friends can access live streaming on their smartphone’s or PC’s browser.  
  
It is so simple to start a live streaming. The live streaming will start by just launching the plugin after connecting THETA to Internet. This plugin uses WebRTC technology. WebRTC is the interactive communications technology which is used widely as a web conference technology. Therefore, you can talk between the THETA holder and the viewer.
