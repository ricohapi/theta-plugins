## Description

<div id="plugin-description">

This plug-in is for THETA X. The URL for the plug-in for THETA Z1 is below.  
https://github.com/ricohapi/theta-plugins/tree/main/plugins/com.theta360.hdri  
  

This plug-in will create high dynamic range images (EXR) in the camera after bracket shooting.  
"Normally, to create high dynamic range images (EXR), it was necessary to perform the lengthy process of shooting an image with the camera and then editing it on a PC before creating EXR data. The HDRI plug-in enables you to use only THETA to simply press the shutter button once to perform the process from shooting to image editing.  
Created high dynamic range images contain information with a wide range of brightness difference. This allows you to use them for ambient lighting when creating CG and rendering, which enables you to reproduce shades of light so that it feels as though you are actually in the space where the image was taken."  
You can also shoot while watching the live preview on the smartphone.
