## Description

<div id="plugin-description">

Woof Shot!  
  
Woof Shot! is a THETA plug-in to support fun dog-focused 360° picture taking.  
Although cats are great, the dog-lovers of the world demanded a dog-specific plug-in for their RICOH THETA cameras! Dogs are great, too!  
Get your dog's attention by making the camera emit a bark and then take their picture.  
  
This plug-in has three commands:  
* Play a pre-recorded dog bark using the THETA speaker.
* Take a 360° picture remotely using a web browser.
* To customize the plug-in so your dog will respond better, record your own voice using the mic in your THETA.
  
To use this plug-in, you do not need to install any mobile apps. You will be using a web browser, either on your smartphone or on a desktop computer.
