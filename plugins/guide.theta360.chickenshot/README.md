## Description

<div id="plugin-description">

This plug-in is called Chicken Shot! and it plays two different bird calls from the THETA internal speaker. It is intended for having use in a chicken pen or maybe outdoors in order to catch chickens or birds doing interesting things. The plug-in is controlled by a webpage with two buttons for the bird calls and one button for taking a picture. This makes it super simple and obvious to use, which is useful when you're trying to take bird pictures.  
  
Basically, there are three things you can do with this plug-in.  
  
* Play two different pre-recorded bird calls using the THETA speaker. Grab the bird's attention!
* Take a 360° picture. Candid shots are the best!
* Record your own voice using the mic in your THETA and use it the same way you were using the bird calls, to attract attention and take pictures.
