## Description
The 360 Hunting Game plug-in is an AR game in which you can catch monsters against a still image captured with your RICOH THETA in the background.  
The monsters that appear change depending on the place where you capture the image, and there are three levels of difficulty: easy, normal, and hard, making the game suitable for all ages.  
Monsters you catch will be added to your monster picture collection, and you’ll be able to see what kind of monsters you’ve caught.  
  
How to start:  
In the basic app for smartphone, select "Settings" > "Camera settings" and set "360 Hunting Game" in "Plug-in", then tap the icon displayed next to "Starting plug-in".  
  
Notes:  
You can not control the camera from the "RICOH THETA" basic app for smartphone when the plug-in is activated.  
Please change the sleep time of the camera from "Settings " in the RICOH THETA application to avoid sleep condition when playing the game.
