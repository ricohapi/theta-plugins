## Description

The THETA Color Tester Plug-in  
  
The RICOH THETA V development environment is extremely flexible and allows developers to use LEDs as they please. LEDs can communicate information about starting an action, a current action, ending an action, and more.  
  
This THETA V plug-in is intended to help other plug-in developers easily identify and test the LEDs on their THETA V. It allows you to turn on and off LEDs individually and and to change their colors.  
  
This plug-in is intended to help others. If you try it and want to add functionality, please contribute.
