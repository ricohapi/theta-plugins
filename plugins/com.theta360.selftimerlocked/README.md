## Description
Self-timer Locked can take a still or a movie with self-timer mode. The shooting conditions are kept as before the plug-in is launched.  
Even using RICOH THETA V with underwater housing case (TW-1), self-timer shooting can be performed.  
  
Operations for RICOH THETA V:

Press and hold the Mode button to launch the plug-in.  
Press the shutter button on the camera to start self-timer.  
The countdown begins and the picture is taken or starting movie capture after the preset time.
