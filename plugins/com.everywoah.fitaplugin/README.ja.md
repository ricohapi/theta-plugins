## 説明

<div id="plugin-description">

Fita is a plug-in suite for Ricoh Theta V owners to connect to Google Cloud Storage.  
As an onboard Theta V camera plug-in and a companion Android or iOS app for your device, Fita allows configuration of a Theta V to upload media to a connected Google Cloud Storage account for optimal workflow and team collaboration for 360º photo and video workflow over WiFi.  
  
The Fita suite is available from the Ricoh plug-in store and on Android Play. An iOS companion Fita app is planned for release.  
  
Utilising on board WiFi and media stitching of the Ricoh Theta V, Fita media uploads to the cloud are considerably faster than before.  
  
The Fita companion app allows plug-in configuration and enables the user to view lower resolution thumbnails of media to be uploaded over onboard Theta V WiFi.  
  
Features under development for Fita include video and batch upload, in camera LED notifications, and additional social media service integrations.  
  
Fita cloud automated workflows, transcoding and 360º video streaming services to connected white label VR app players are on the development roadmap for enterprise capabilities.  
  
Fita is developed by an experienced independent team of 360º, VR, AR professionals at Everywoah.
