## Description

<div id="plugin-description">

This plug-in makes it easy to capture images of illuminated streets.  
  
When shooting night scenes with RICOH THETA in the shooting mode “Auto”, images do not always turn out exactly the way the scene looks.
It is necessary to change shooting settings depending on lighting conditions in order to capture beautiful images of scenes with insufficient lighting such as night scenes.  
The Instant Night Snap Plug-in configures the optimal shooting settings for night scenes so that you can easily capture images of illuminated streets.  
  
The Instant Night Snap Plug-in automatically determines if handheld shooting is performed and changes the shooting settings. If the plug-in determines that the camera is fixed, the image is captured five seconds after the shutter button is pressed.  
  
You can use the Remote Control TR-1 only when shooting with the RICOH THETA Z1. When using the TR-1, the shutter is released when the shutter button on the TR-1 is pressed, regardless of handheld or fixed shooting. Enable the remote control before starting this plug-in.  

  
* Handheld shooting: Shutter Priority mode is used when shooting.  

  * THETA Z1: “HANDHELD POSITION” is displayed on the OLED panel.  
  * THETA V: The wireless lamp lights in magenta.  


* Fixed shooting: ISO Priority mode is used when shooting.  

  * THETA Z1: “FIXED POSITION” is displayed on the OLED panel.  
  * THETA V: The wireless lamp lights in cyan.  
  

* Make sure to either secure the camera to a tripod or set it directly in a stable location to perform fixed shooting.  
 When using equipment such as self-standing monopods, etc., the distance from the movement pivot point to the camera is long,  
 so pressing the shutter button will cause significant shaking, which may make fixed shooting impossible.  

* Can be used with JPEG only


[Operation method]
